this was eye-opening for me, someone who's just getting into ui/ux designing. 
looking at a blank frame on figma was daunting for me initially, 
but breaking down the process into these steps and essential questions compartmentalizes 
the process of beginning for me, which makes things seem way less daunting. 
i also liked how the article mentioned that making lofi wireframes can be just as valuable 
as super detailed, precise ones. overall an insightful read.
